## Stock Market App (Tradiction)
Tradiction is a stock trading app that allows users the ability to browse recent stock-related news articles while also giving them the ability to buy, sell, and view stocks. Unlike other stock trading apps, Tradicition implements a proprietary sentimental analysis algorithm that analyzes twitter comments to keep users up to date on the latest trending market chatter. Tradiction also provides a feature allowing traders to communicate directly with stock experts, giving the trader the best market advice and information related to the stock possible. Tradiction can be found at http://ec2-18-222-193-100.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000.

# Challenges and Solution during the project
Some of the non-technical challenges that we faced were:
- ` Managing the schedule was difficult in the begining as result we missed the first two meetings. `
- ` Meeting the deadlines were also challenging because some team members would be behind in their assigned work. `
- ` Couple of team members hadn't used git version control so it took them a while to get used to it, which also delayed the development. `

Some of the technical challenges that we faced were:
- `It took time to understand different concepts like business requirements, prototypes, High-level architecture, low-level architecture, web-app servers and so on.`
- `Setting the enviroment on AWS was also challenge in the begining as I faced issues with security groups, inbound, outbound rules and pem files.`
- `We also faced issues with uniformity in our web pages. We solved it after creating design system which dictated how each elements of the web page should look and interact.`
- `I had to spent a lot of time configuring gunicorn and nginx to use them as an appication server and web server respectively. I had minimal idea on their concept before that.`
- `Faced multiple challenges while creating ERD diagrams, databasemodel and schema from the the business rules. For instance, I remember having issues with assigning proper relationship between entities table like one to many, many to many etc.`
