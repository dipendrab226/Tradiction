## Stock Market App (Tradiction)
Tradiction is a stock trading app that allows users the ability to browse recent stock-related news articles while also giving them the ability to buy, sell, and view stocks. Unlike other stock trading apps, Tradicition implements a proprietary sentimental analysis algorithm that analyzes twitter comments to keep users up to date on the latest trending market chatter. Tradiction also provides a feature allowing traders to communicate directly with stock experts, giving the trader the best market advice and information related to the stock possible. Tradiction can be found at http://ec2-18-222-193-100.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000.
